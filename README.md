# Problem-Solving-IB-Series

## Let's first learn How to solve problems in an in interview in the first place.

- Understand the problem very well.
 - Sometimes people just leave this part that means they start focusing on finding the solution to the problem without having the clear picture of the problem in their head. And that should not be done. 
  - the output thatis expected from you must be same as your output and that will happen only when you'll have a clear picture of the question in your mind.
 - You should ask the interviewer questions that you have about the edge cases etc.
 - See the constraints [In this part ask the interviewer a lot of Relevant questions]
 - You must know what time and space complexity is expected in your answer otherwise you will not be able to give the interviewer an optimal solution.
 - For example you have to find prime numbers. The question you should ask would look like:
  - Are the numbers negaitve?
  - Whatis the range of the numers that you have to check?

- Take bigger examples in order to understand tricky test cases.
 - You should try to run the tricky edge cases in your code in order to know whether or not your answer is viable.
- Whenever you are approaching a problem you must SPEAK OUT LOUD.
 - This means that you have to speak out your thought process to your interviewer i.e. the interviewer must know what is going in your mind while solving the prooblem. 
 - This will help the interviewer to understand how do you approach a problem and even if you are stuck at some place interviewer will be able to help you as he now knows your thought process and knows at which point you are stuck.
 - Sometimes you might be following a totally wrong approach that is not viable for the question so in that case interviewer will be able to tell you that 'Hey the appraoch you are trying might not work so try something else' thus you'll save a hell lot of time in interviews.
- Come up with a Pseudo code.
 - Basically it means write everything in English. 
 - Basically here you have to explain your appproach to the interviewer before writing the actual code by writing it as Pseudo code.
- Implementation.
 - Now when you've showed your Pseudo code to the interviewer now is the time to ask the interviewer that if you can implement this approach or can you implement this Pseudo code in C++/Java (whatever language you prefer) and if the interviewer says yes then you are good to go.
- All test cases should pass.
 - At last interviewer will ask you 'check your implementation, are you missing something' or 'check if the implementation is correct' then in order to verify that you have to check whether all the test cases satisfy or not.
